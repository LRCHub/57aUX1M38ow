See the light of those who find
As time pass you by, you're still left behind
Time has come for you to see
That life is a game you'd rather play or flee
The ivory gates cast shadows, might betray
Surrender this night, or choose my way
Come with me, I'll take you there
To the land of make belive
Let us fly beyond our dreams, fall into reverie
On the wings of destiny, I will claim our liberty
With the power of the steel
With the power of the steel
With the power of the steel
Dreamland will reveal
All you see is black or white
You have to spell out what's wrong or right
Spoken words may have let you down
It's time to stand up and rise with the sun
You entered the gates and there's nothing left to fear
But don't let the matter stand, you're near
Come with me, I'll take you there
To the land of make belive
Let us fly beyond our dreams, fall into reverie
On the wings of destiny, I will claim our liberty
With the power of the steel
With the power of the steel
With the power of the steel
Dreamland will reveal
Let me know if you want to go, there's a place for you and me
Let me take you to the temple of your heart, let me know
You entered the gates and there's nothing left to fear
But don't let the matter stand, you're near
Come with me, I'll take you there
To the land of make belive
Let us fly beyond our dreams, fall into reverie
On the wings of destiny, I will claim our liberty
With the power of the steel
With the power of the steel
With the power of the steel
Dreamland will reveal
